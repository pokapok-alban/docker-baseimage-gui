    A minimal docker baseimage to ease creation of X graphical application
    containers
  description: |-
    This is a docker baseimage that can be used to create containers able to run
    any X application on a headless server very easily. The application's GUI
    is accessed through a modern web browser (no installation or configuration
    needed on the client side) or via any VNC client.

        Port used by the web server to serve the UI of the application. This
        port is used internally by the container and it is usually not required
        to be changed. By default, a container is created with the default
        bridge network, meaning that, to be accessible, each internal container
        port must be mapped to an external port (using the `-p` or `--publish`
        argument). However, if the container is created with another network
        type, changing the port used by the container might be useful to prevent
        conflict with other services/containers. **NOTE**: a value of `-1`
        disables listening, meaning that the application's UI won't be
        accessible over HTTP/HTTPs.
